pyShift - Rigid Motion for 3D Grids
===================================

**pyShift** module features include a cartesian mesh generator and a rigid 3D
grid motion.
Grids, or meshes, are 3D structured meshes with (``i``, ``j``, ``k``) 
indexes.

Availble grid generators are:

 * square ([#N1]_)
 * rectangle 
 * cube 
 * parallepip√®de

The cartesian grid defines x,y,z points in a 3 dimensions (i,j,k) array.
Coordinates go from 1 to N for N points, N is the parameter for the grid
generation [#N2]_.
 
.. [#N1] topological dim is 2, physical dims is 3

The module uses *numpy* arrays for grids coordinates.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#N2] The first and the last point of the grid are included,
         a parameter value of 3 for a square generates a square of 9 points.
